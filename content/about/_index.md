# About Me

Hey there! I'm Kevin, a third year Operations Research Student also completing a Computing Science minor at Simon Fraser University. I've always been the one to stand at a store comparing different products trying to pick which one is the best for me, combining that with my passion towards mathematics, statistics, and computing, it naturally led me to the field of decision science and data analytics. My primary interests are in public transportation and consumer behaviour, and I'm eager for any opportunities that come along the way!
