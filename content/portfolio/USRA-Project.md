I am currently working on this project under the supervision of Paul Tupper, Department of Mathematics at Simon Fraser University. More details about the project will be released in August.

## Website Description

Project: Assessing when Political Content is a "Gateway Drug" to Other Political Content

Recently a study by Finkelstein, Stevens, al-Gharbi claimed, using records of comments on various political websites, that psychologist Jordan Peterson is a "gateway drug" to extremist alt right content. The student taking on this project will examine this study and others like it and develop a mathematical model of ideological development and content consumption. Such a model can then be used to study other examples of gateways in content consumption, not necessarily in the political context.


## Work So Far...
This section will be documented in more detail in August.

To better understand if there exists a radicalization pathway on the YouTube platform where consumers are drawn towards the content of the far right, I've web scraped over 800 YouTube Channels and 2000 YouTube Videos and their recommendations. This data was then transformed and modelled to create a markov probability matrix to better analyze consumer behaviour on the Platform.
