This course contains 4 project those being: 

### [Search](http://ai.berkeley.edu/search.html)

This project explored implementations of Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, Uniform Cost Search, and A* Search. This project also explored methods of state value representation and heuristics

### [Multi-Agent Search](http://ai.berkeley.edu/multiagent.html)

This project explored implementations of AI gameplay. Specifically covering implementing Reflex Agents, MiniMax, Alpha-Beta Pruning Mini-Max, ExpectiMax, and evaluation functions

### [Ghost Busters](http://ai.berkeley.edu/tracking.html)

This project explored Markov and Hidden Markov Models, with applications to particle filtering. Specifically implementing Exact and Approximate Inference and a joint particle filter.

### [Classification](http://ai.berkeley.edu/classification.html)

This project was not completed since I am working on a more comprehensive Machine Learning Course on this [repo](https://github.com/kaishuun/Standford-Machine-Learning)
